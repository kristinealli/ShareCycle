SHARE CYCLE
PROJECT: 
Application designed to facilitate the sharing of items among users. It allows individuals to lend or borrow various items, promoting a collaborative and resource-efficient approach to ownership. Will foster a sense of community by promoting item sharing and reducing unnecessary consumption. The app will simplify and easily organize the process of lending and borrowing items while ensuring transparency and accountability through photos and reminders. Users can contribute to a more sustainable and resource-conscious lifestyle by participating in the sharing economy. Triple Top Line Value, Baby! 

User Registration, User Authentication: Users will need to register and sign in and create an account to access the application. 

Items: Users can list items they are willing to share, each item is associated with details such as it’s name, description, category, and availability status. 

Loan Management: Users can request to borrow items from other users. Loans are tracked 
with information, including loan date, due date, return date, and loan status.

Photo Upload: Users can upload photos of items both before and after a loan. Photos provide a visual record to ensure item condition and accountability.

Reminder System: Notify users about upcoming loan due dates. This helps users return borrowed items on time, improving the overall lending experience.

User Profiles: Users have profiles where they can manage their listed items and view their borrowing history. Profiles help users keep track of their lending and borrowing activities.

Search and Filter: Users can search for specific items based on various criteria, such as location or category. Filtering options make it easy to find items that match their needs.
